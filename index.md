# About Me

Hello, my name is Atharva Tyagi! I'm a junior at Ridge High School in Basking Ridge, NJ. I'm passionate about machine learning, data science, and software development. In my free time, I enjoy participating in hackathons, coding competitions, and exploring new technologies.

# Recent Research Experience

## Machine Learning-Based Flux Footprint Emulator over a Solar Array
### October 2025–Present
*   Created a **novel 41 GB** dataset with Python containing 10,202 samples of lake-effect precipitation from public data on AWS
*   **Enhanced a pix2pix GAN** model with a UNetFormer generator on each of four Great Lakes to produce superior results to the state-of-the-art HRRR numerical model
*   Earned a **grand award** ([fourth in category](https://isef.net/project/eaev048-ml-based-lake-effect-precipitation-prediction)) at the 2025 **International Science and Engineering Fair** and [published paper](https://doi.org/10.1175/AIES-D-25-0009.1)

## Next-Hour Lake-Effect Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts over the Great Lakes with Deep Learning
### September 2024–September 2025
*   Developing **first-of-its-kind flux footprint emulation** over non-homogenous surface geometries with [Dr. Ankur Desai](https://flux.aos.wisc.edu/)
*   Using **CFD simulations over a solar array** with [FastEddy](https://ral.ucar.edu/fasteddy) to generate high-resolution **flux footprint targets** with [STLIT](https://uataq.github.io/stilt/#/)
*   Utilizing **fourier neural operators** to learn mappings from environmental variables to target flux footprints
